### <b>GENERAL GIST OF THE PROBLEM</b>
> [EXPLANATION BY JUSTIN]

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52179570508_4b604d3c13_k.jpg)


<p class="outline">The **Monty Hall Problem** will be discussed following the outline: <br><br>
1. *Why Switch and Why Not* <br> 
2. *Standard Math Way* <br> 
3. *Program Simulation Using Python* <br>
</p>

### <b>WHY SWITCH AND WHY NOT</b>

### <b>MONTY HALL SIMULATION USING R</b> {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### About the Simulation

> The discussed mathematical theorem implies that always switching after the one door is opened serves as the most sensible choice. We can push the concept of the Monty Hall problem by exploring it through an original simulation based on R program. Right before knitting the HTML, the program ran through one hundred thousands test runs.
>
> Explore the program by navigating through the tabs, where the rate of success given three doors with one car and two goats that are randomly arranged is shown at the bottom of the R program.

#### Simulation 1: Never Switching

> The code is shown below. Comments are readily available to guide readers through the program.

```{r}
winCtr <- 0
trials <- 100000

#this program simulation executed 100 thousand test runs to get the approximate value of the probability of winning
for(total in 0:trials){
  
  #real list signifies the actual positions of the two goats and one car
  real <- c(0,0,0)
  #pick list represents the initial guess of the player
  pick <- c(0,0,0)
  sum <- c(0,0,0)
  
  #generate the actual order and the guessed order
  real[sample(1:3,1)] = 1
  pick[sample(1:3,1)] = 1
  
  #add the corresponding elements of the two vectors
  sum <- c(real[1]+pick[1], real[2]+pick[2], real[3]+pick[3])
  
  
  if(2 %in% sum){
    #the presence of '2' in the sum vector means that the player's guess coincides with the reality
    winCtr <- winCtr + 1
    #program simulation counts this as one win
  }
}

#program simulation displays the probability of winning after finishing the 100 thousand test runs
cat("Success Rate: ", (winCtr/total)*100, "%")
```

> <b>Let's Discuss:</b>
> Setting the simulation to never switch even after the host opens one door yields a success rate that approaches 33%, which coheres with the mathematical theorem discussed. Staying with the initial guess corresponds to the simple probability of getting that one car out of three doors, which is exactly 1/3.

#### Simulation 2: Always Switching

> The code is shown below. Comments are readily available to guide readers through the program.

```{r}
#TEST 1: ALWAYS CHANGING DOORS 

winCtr <- 0
trials <- 100000

#this program simulation executed 100 thousand test runs to get the approximate value of the probability of winning
for (total in 0:trials){
  
  #basic initializations
  open <- 0
  lastPick <- 0
  
  #three doors exists: '0' denotes the goat while '1' represents the car
  #note only one car hides behind the three doors
  
  #real vector signifies the actual positions of the two goats and one car
  real <- c(0,0,0)
  #pick vector represents the initial guess of the player
  pick <- c(0,0,0)
  
   #loc vector notes down the location/index of the doors that the player did not choose
  loc <- c(1,2,3)
  
  sum <- c(0,0,0)
  
  
  #generate the actual order and the guessed order
  real[sample(1:3,1)] = 1
  pick[sample(1:3,1)] = 1
  
  #add the corresponding elements of the two vectors
  sum <- c(real[1]+pick[1], real[2]+pick[2], real[3]+pick[3])
  
  if(2 %in% sum){
    
    #the presence of '2' in sum implies that the player guessed right initially
    loc <- loc[-(which(sum == 2))]
    
    #the host opens a random door that has a goat and the player hasn't guessed
    open <- loc[sample(1:2,1)]
    
    #the simulation then deletes the opened door out of the lists
    real <- real[-open]
    pick <- pick[-open]
    sum <- sum[-open]
    
    #only two choices now remain
    #the following the Monty Hall concept, the player changes door
    #changing from '2' to '0' in the sum list
    
    lastPick <- loc[which(sum == 0)]
    
    if(lastPick == 2){
      #simulation will never flow through here
      winCtr = winCtr + 1
    }
    #the player would never get the car in this condition
    
  } else{
    #the absence of '2' implies that the player's guess was initially wrong
    
    #the host opens that ONE door that has a goat and the player hasn't guessed
    open <- which(sum == 0)
    
     #the simulation then deletes the opened door out of the vectors
    real <- real[-open]
    pick <- pick[-open]
    sum <- sum[-open]
    
    #only two choices now remain
    #the following the Monty Hall concept, the player changes door
    #the door where the player changes to is already certain (to the index with a '0' element in the pick list)
    
    lastPick <- which(pick == 0)
    pick = c(0,0)
    pick[lastPick] <- 1
    
     #the sum of the two lists containing two elements is summed up
    sum <- c(real[1]+pick[1], real[2]+pick[2])

    if(2 %in% sum){
      #an element of '2' corresponds to a correct guess and the simulation counts that as one win
      #program simulation always flows to this condition if the player's guess was initially wrong
      winCtr = winCtr + 1
    }
  }
}

cat("Success Rate: ", (winCtr/total)*100, "%")
```
> <b>Let's Discuss:</b>
> This simulation confirmed the mathematical principle that switchin leads to a higher success rate of around 66%. Largely deducing from the flow of the program shows, it follows that two major conditions exists:
> 1. The player initially chooses right.
> 2. The player initially chooses wrong.
> Switching choices for the first condition will certainly lead to a wrong choice while likewise changing choices for the second condition always leads to the right choice. Since only two doors remain after the host revealed one door containing the goat, the unselected door must have the car given that the initial guess is wrong.
>
> Notice that a reversal occurs, in which right choice becomes wrong and vice versa. Thus, the success rate of changing the choice after one door opens corresponds to the complement of the probability of the alternative: 1/3. It follows that its complement is 2/3, which is approximately 66%.

### <b>ULTRA LOTTO PROBLEM: MATHEMATICAL SOLUTION</b>

In lotteries, the order of selection of the numbers *do not matter*. Hence, solving for the number of all possible combinations in the Ultra Lotto 6/58 employs **Combinations** since they consider any un-ordered arrangement of objects from a collection. 

*Note* that the **Combination Formula** is given as:

$$
_{n}C_{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$

where $r$ is the number of objects that can be formed from a collection of $n$ objects. In the case of the Ultra Lotto 6/58, one must choose $6$ numbers from a collection of $58$. Therefore, substituting these numbers to $r$ and $n$, respectively, yields the following: 

$$
_{58}C_{6} = \frac{58!}{6!(58-6)!}= 40,475,358
$$

<br>

After using the Combination Formula, we find that the amount of all possible combination of numbers is equal to approximately $40.5 \textrm{ million}$ combinations or tickets. 

At $P20$ per ticket, a bettor would have to spend an amount equal to the number of all possible combinations multiplied by the said price.

$$
\textrm{amount to spend}=P20 \cdot 40,475,358=P809,507,160 
$$
<br>

Purchasing tickets containing all combinations, the bettor will surely win the lotto prize of $P50 \textrm{ million}$. However, spending approximately a total of $P809.5 \textrm{ million}$ means that the bettor would incur a massive loss.

To find out how much exactly an individual can win in the 6/58, the rules of PCSO's Ultra Lotto 6/58 indicate that those who get 3/4/5 of the 6 winning numbers are eligible for a consolation prize. As of June 28, 2022, the PCSO consolation prize pool is as follows:

- 2nd place - 5 out of 6 winning nos. - $P120,000.00$
- 3rd place - 4 out of 6 winning nos. - $P2,000.00$
- 4th place - 3 out of 6 winning nos. - $P100.00$

*note that the current prize pool is $P49.50\textrm million$ but the prize pool in the scenario is $P5 \textrm million$. 
<br>

Since you bought all combinations, you will get the 442,000 tickets that got 3 out of the 6 winning numbers, which gives $P44,200,000.00$ .

$$
_{6}C_{3} \cdot [_{(58-6)}C_{(6-3)}]=442,000
$$

$$
442,000 \cdot P100.00= P44,200,000
$$

<br>

Do note that the 6/58 follows the pari-mutuel system pertaining to a betting pool in which those who win within the first three places share the total amount bet.

In case someone else but you wins a prize in the lottery, you will be splitting the top three prizes, effectively sinking you further in debt; but in case you are the sole winner, your total winnings would be $P94,322,000.00$ (without tax).

$$
\textrm{total winnings}=P50,000,000 + P120,000 + P2,000 + P44,200,000 = P94,322,000
$$

<br>

Regardless if you consider the consolation prizes ($debt_2$) or not $(debt_1)$, you will still be in enormous debt since neither of the outcomes would make you break even.

$$
\textrm{debt}_1= P809,507,160-P50,000,000=P759,507,160
$$
$$
\textrm{debt}_2=P809,507,160-P94,322,000=P715,185,160
$$

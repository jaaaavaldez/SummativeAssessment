### <b>ULTRA LOTTO PROBLEM: MATHEMATICAL SOLUTION</b>

In lotteries, the order of selection of the numbers *do not matter*. Hence, solving for the number of all possible combinations in the Ultra Lotto 6/58 employs **Combinations** since they consider any unordered arrangement of objects from a collection. 

*Note* that the **Combination Formula** is given as:
$$
_{n}C_{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$
where $r$ is the number of objects that can be formed from a collection of $n$ objects. In the case of the Ultra Lotto 6/58, one must choose $6$ numbers from a collection of $58$. Therefore, substituting these numbers to $r$ and $n$, respectively, yields the following: 
$$
_{58}C_{6} = \frac{58!}{6!(58-6)!}= 40,475,358
$$
After using the Combination Formula, we find that the amount of all possible combination of numbers is equal to approximately $40.5 \textrm{ million}$ combinations or tickets. 

At $P20$ per ticket, a bettor would have to spend an amount equal to the number of all possible combinations multiplied by the said price.
$$
\textrm{amount to spend}=P20 \cdot 40,475,358=P809,507,160 
$$
Purchasing tickets containing all combinations, the bettor will surely win the lotto prize of $P50 \textrm{ million}$. However, spending approximately a total of $P809.5 \textrm{ million}$ means that the bettor would incur a massive loss as they would be left with a debt of approximately $P759.5 \textrm{ million}$.
